# C1_MS_2023 - Challenge 1#

## Description

This challenge was completed to demonstrate the right use what I have learned of HTML structure and CSS in week #1 of the UNB Coding Bootcamp.

In this opportunity I was able to adjust the given template to meet the accesibility requirement, as well as to organize and merge some of the CSS elements to make the code leaner.
